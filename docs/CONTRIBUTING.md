Bugs/problems
-------------
If your problem is not addressed in the documentation please do raise an issue on github. Please give as much
information as possible, including the command you used, the output you saw, and if possible a minimal working
example with files you used (e.g. a single variant example, rather than the whole k-mer/vcf file).

Enhancements
------------
All enhancements and fixes are very much appreciated!

For small fixes you can email suggested changes to the authors, or fork the repo and make a pull request.

For larger additions or changes, we would appreciate it if you emailed us first to discuss, to minimize merge
conflicts and overlap in work. You are welcome to suggest such changes through a pull request.
