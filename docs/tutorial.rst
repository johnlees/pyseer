For a short introduction to bacterial GWAS, you may wish to read
`this review <https://figshare.com/articles/The_background_of_bacterial_GWAS/5550037>`_.

This tutorial shows how to use ``pyseer`` to perform a GWAS for penicillin
resistance using 616 *S.*\ |nbsp| \ *pneumoniae* genomes collected from Massachusetts.
These genomes were first reported `here <https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.2625>`__ and can be accessed
`here <https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201558>`__. One of the earliest GWAS
studies in bacteria was performed using this data, and we will try to
replicate `their results <http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004547>`__.

The data for this tutorial can be accessed `here <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pOnTS-KW_iNZ5t8kRpMLoTB9Jca3_MJt>`__.

SNP and COG association with fixed effects model
------------------------------------------------
We will first of all demonstrate using ``pyseer`` with the original ``seer`` model,
using MDS components as fixed effects to control for the population structure.
We will test the association of SNPs mapped to a reference (provided as a VCF file) and COG
presence/absence (provided as and Rtab file, from running roary on the
annotations).

The first step is to estimate the population structure. We will do this using
a pairwise distance matrix produced using ``mash``. Either create the mash
sketches yourself::

   mkdir assemblies
   cd assemblies
   tar xf ../assemblies.tar.bz2
   cd ..
   mash sketch -s 10000 -o mash_sketch assemblies/*.fa

or use the pre-computed ``mash_sketch.msh`` directly. Next, use these to
calculate distances between all pairs of samples::

   mash dist mash_sketch.msh mash_sketch.msh| square_mash > mash.tsv

.. note:: Alternatively, we could extract patristic distances from a phylogeny:
   ``python scripts/phylogeny_distance.py core_genome_aln.tree > phylogeny_dists.tsv``

Let's perform an MDS and these distances and look at a scree plot to choose the number of
dimensions to retain::

   scree_plot_pyseer mash.tsv

.. image:: scree_plot.png
   :alt: scree plot of MDS components
   :align: center

There is a drop after about 8 dimensions, so we will use this many. This is
subjective, and you may choose to include many more. This is
a sensitivity/specificity tradeoff -- choosing more components is more likely
to reduce false positives from population structure, at the expense of power.
Using more components will also slightly increase computation time.

We can now run the analysis on the COGs::

   pyseer --phenotypes resistances.pheno --pres gene_presence_absence.Rtab --distances mash.tsv --save-m mash_mds --max-dimensions 8 > penicillin_COGs.txt

Which prints the following to STDERR::

   Read 603 phenotypes
   Detected binary phenotype
   Structure matrix has dimension (616, 616)
   Analysing 603 samples found in both phenotype and structure matrix
   10944 loaded variants
   4857 filtered variants
   6087 tested variants
   6087 printed variants

``pyseer`` has automatically matched the sample labels between the inputs, and
only used those which were present in the phenotype file. This has accounted
for the fact that not all of the samples were measured for the current
phenotype. We have used the default filters, so only intermediate frequency
COGs have been considered. The core genome COGs and low frequency COGs are in
the 4857 filtered out. Take a look at the top hits::

Note that the first two rows have notes ``high-bse`` and ``bad-chisq``
respectively. For the former this may represent a high effect size, low
frequency results. For the latter this is likely due to the MAF filter not
being stringent enough. The identical p-values of the other results are as these COGs
appear in exactly the same set of samples.

We will now perform an analysis using the SNPs produced from mapping reads
against the provided reference genome. To speed up the program we will load the
MDS decomposition ``mash_mds.pkl`` which was created by the COG analysis above::

   pyseer --phenotypes resistances.pheno --vcf snps.vcf.gz --load-m mash_mds.pkl --lineage --print-samples > penicillin_SNPs.txt

This gives similar log messages::

   Read 603 phenotypes
   Detected binary phenotype
   Loaded projection with dimension (603, 269)
   Analysing 603 samples found in both phenotype and structure matrix
   Writing lineage effects to lineage_effects.txt
   198248 loaded variants
   81370 filtered variants
   116878 tested variants
   116700 printed variants

We haven't specified the number of MDS dimensions to retain, so the default of
10 will be used (anything up to the 269 retained positive eigenvalues could be
chosen). Turning on the test for lineage effects with ``--lineage`` uses the
MDS components as the lineage, and writes the lineages most associated with
the phenotype to ``lineage_effects.txt``::

   lineage wald_test       p-value
   MDS3    10.3041807281   0.0
   MDS10   6.61332035523   3.75794950713e-11
   MDS5    6.03559150525   1.58381441295e-09

   MDS1    0.478181602218  0.632520955891
   MDS8    0.344928992152  0.730147754076

Variants associated with both the phenotype and MDS3, MDS10 or MDS5 may
therefore be of interest as lineage effects.

The output now includes the lineage each variant is associated with, though not
all variants can be assigned a lineage. ``--print-samples`` forces the
inclusion of a comma separated list of samples the variant is present in
``k-samples`` and not present in ``nk-samples`` (not shown here for brevity)::

This contains co-ordinates and p-values, which can be converted to a ``.plot``
file using the following ``awk`` one-liner::

   cat <(echo "#CHR SNP BP minLOG10(P) log10(p) r^2") \\ 
   <(paste <(sed '1d' penicillin_SNPs.txt | cut -d "_" -f 2) \\
   <(sed '1d' penicillin_SNPs.txt | cut -f 4) | \\
   awk '{p = -log($2)/log(10); print "26",".",$1,p,p,"0"}' ) | \\
   tr ' ' '\t' > penicillin_snps.plot

If we drag and drop ``23FSpn.gff`` and ``penicillin_snps.plot`` files into
`phandango <http://jameshadfield.github.io/phandango/#/>`_ you should see
a Manhattan plot similar to this:

.. image:: pbp_manhattan.png
   :alt: Manhattan plot of penicillin resistance SNPs
   :align: center

The three highest peaks are in the *pbp2x*, *pbp1a* and *pbp2b* genes,
which are the correct loci. There are also flat lines, suggesting
these may be lineage effects from population structure that has not been fully
controlled for. In actual fact, if we inspect the SNPs along these two lines
(``p = 2.10E-14`` and ``p = 1.58E-15``) we see that all of them are annotated
with the note ``bad-chisq`` and are at the lower end of the included minor allele
frequency threshold (1.3% and 1.2% respectively). These are therefore variants
which were underpowered, and the associations are spurious. They should be
filtered out, and we should probably have used a MAF cutoff of at least 2%
given the total number of samples we have. As a rule of thumb, a MAF cutoff
corresponding to a MAC of at least 10 isn't a bad start. Let's run it again::

   pyseer --phenotypes resistances.pheno --vcf snps.vcf.gz --load-m output/mash_mds.pkl --min-af 0.02 --max-af 0.98 > penicillin_SNPs.txt

   Read 603 phenotypes
   Detected binary phenotype
   Loaded projection with dimension (603, 269)
   Analysing 603 samples found in both phenotype and structure matrix
   198248 loaded variants
   106949 filtered variants
   91299 tested variants
   91225 printed variants

A lot more low frequency variants have been filtered out this time, and if we
make a plot file our Manhattan plot looks much cleaner:

.. image:: pbp_manhattan_clean.png

   :align: center


K-mer association with mixed effects model
------------------------------------------
We will now use k-mers as a variant to test both short variation as well as
gene presence/absence. This can be done using the steps above replacing the
``--vcf`` argument with ``--kmers``, which would replicate the results from the
original ``seer`` tutorial. For demonstration purposes we will instead use the
other association model available in ``pyseer``, the linear mixed model.

First, count the k-mers from the assemblies::

   mkdir -p assemblies
   cd assemblies
   tar xvf ../assemblies.tar.bz2
   fsm-lite -l ../fsm_file_list.txt -s 6 -S 610 -v -t fsm_kmers | gzip -c - > ../fsm_kmers.txt.gz
   cd ..

This will require you to have `fsm-lite <https://github.com/nvalimak/fsm-lite>`_ installed
If you do not have the time/resources to do this, you can follow the rest of these steps using the
SNPs as above.

To correct for population structure we must supply ``pyseer`` with the kinship
matrix :math:`K` using the ``--similarities`` argument (or ``--load-lmm`` if using
a previous analysis where ``--save-lmm`` was used).

We will use the distances from the core genome phylogeny, which
has been midpointed rooted::

   python scripts/phylogeny_distance.py --calc-C core_genome_aln.tree > phylogeny_K.tsv

.. note:: Alternatively, we could extract a kinship matrix from the mapped SNPs by calculating :math:`K = GG^T`
   ``similarity --vcf snps.vcf.gz samples.txt > gg.snps.txt``

We can now run ``pyseer`` with ``--lmm``. Due to the large number of k-mers we are going to test, we will increase the
number of CPUs used to 8::

   pyseer --lmm --phenotypes resistances.pheno --kmers fsm_kmers.txt.gz --similarity phylogeny_K.tsv --output-patterns kmer_patterns.txt --cpu 8 > penicillin_kmers.txt

The heritability :math:`h^2` estimated from the kinship matrix :math:`K` is printed to STDERR,
and after about 5 hours the results have finished being written::

   Read 603 phenotypes
   Detected binary phenotype
   Setting up LMM
   Similarity matrix has dimension (616, 616)
   Analysing 603 samples found in both phenotype and similarity matrix
   h^2 = 0.90
   15167239 loaded variants
   1042215 filtered variants
   14125024 tested variants
   14124993 printed variants

.. note:: The heritability estimate shouldn't be interpreted as a quantitative measure
   for this binary phenotype, but a high heritability is consistent with the mechanism of penicillin
   resistance in this species (the sequence can give up to `99% prediction
   accuracy <http://mbio.asm.org/content/7/3/e00756-16>`_ of penicillin resistance).

The results look similar, though also include the heritability of each variant
tested::

The downstream processing of the k-mer results in ``penicillin_kmers.txt`` will be
shown in the next section. Before that, we can determine a significance threshold
using the number of unique k-mer patterns::

   python scripts/count_patterns.py kmer_patterns.txt
   Patterns:       2627332
   Threshold:      1.90E-08

This is over five times lower than the total number of k-mers tested, so stops
us from being hyper-conservative with the multiple testing correction.

We can also create a Q-Q plot to check that p-values are not inflated. We can do that
by using the ``qq_plot.py`` script::

   python scripts/qq_plot.py penicillin_kmers.txt

which produces the following Q-Q plot:

.. image:: lmm_qq_python.png
   :alt: Q-Q plot of penicillin resistance k-mers
   :align: center

When interpreting this plot, check that it is well controlled at low p-values and doesn't
show any large 'shelves' symptomatic of poorly controlled confounding population
structure. Although this plot is far above the null (as indeed, there are many
k-mers associated with penicillin resistance), the p-values up to 0.01 are as expected
which is what we're after.


Interpreting significant k-mers
-------------------------------
For the final step we will work with only those k-mers which exceeded the
significance threshold in the mixed model analysis. We will filter these from
the output using a simple ``awk`` command::

   cat <(head -1 penicillin_kmers.txt) <(awk '$4<1.90E-08 {print $0}' penicillin_kmers.txt) > significant_kmers.txt

There are 5327 significant k-mers.

Mapping to a single reference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let's use ``bwa mem`` to map these to
the reference provided::

   phandango_mapper significant_kmers.txt Spn23F.fa Spn23F_kmers.plot

   Read 5327 k-mers
   Mapped 2425 k-mers

Not all the k-mers have been mapped, which is usually the case. Note there are 2459
mapping lines in the output, as 34 secondary mappings we included. It is a good idea
to map to range of references to help with an interpretion for all of the significant
k-mers. The k-mer annotation step, described next, also helps cover all k-mers. Let's
look at the plot file in `phandango <http://jameshadfield.github.io/phandango/#/>`_:

.. image:: kmer_phandango.png
   :alt: Manhattan of penicillin resistance k-mers
   :align: center

In this view we no longer see all of the Manhattan plot as we have filtered out
the low p-value k-mers. There is generally less noise due to LD/population structure when
compared to our previous result above. There are peaks in the three *pbp* genes again, with
the strongest results in *pbp2x* and *pbp2b* as before. Zooming in:

.. image:: kmer_phandango_zoom.png
   :alt: Zoomed Manhattan of penicillin resistance k-mers
   :align: center

The whole *pbp2x* gene is covered by significant k-mers, whereas only a small
part of *pbp1a* is hit. This could be due to the fact that only some sites
in *pbp1a* can be variable, only some of the variable sites affect penicllin
resistance, or due to the ability to map k-mers to this region.

Annotating k-mers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We can annotate these k-mers with the genes they are found in, or are near. To
try and map every k-mer we can include a number of different reference
annotations, as well as all the draft annotations of the sequences the k-mers
were counted from. For the purposes of this tutorial we will demonstrate with
a single type of each annotation, but this could be expanded by adding all
the annotated assemblies to the input.

We'll start by creating a ``references.txt`` file listing the annotations we
wish to use::

   Spn23F.fa	Spn23F.gff	ref
   6952_7#3.fa	6952_7#3.fa	draft

Now run the script. This will iterate down the list of annotations, annotating the k-mers which
haven't already been mapped to a previous annotation (requires ``bedtools``, ``bedops`` and the
``pybedtools`` package)::

   annotate_hits_pyseer significant_kmers.txt references.txt annotated_kmers.txt

   Reference 1
   5327 kmers remain
   Draft reference 2
   2902 kmers remain

.. note:: If this runs slowly you can split the ``significant_kmers.txt`` file into
   pieces to parallelise the process.

Annotations marked ``ref`` can partially match between k-mer and reference
sequence, whereas those marked ``draft`` require an exact match. In this case
the single draft didn't add any matches.
The genes a k-mer is in, as well as the nearest upstream and downstream are added to the
output::

   TTTTTTTCTACAATAAAATAGGCTCCATAATATCTATAGTGGATTTACCCACTACAAATATTATAGAACCCGTTTTATTATGGAAAGACTTATTGGACTT    6.47E-02        2.08E-12        2.10E-09        7.97E-01        1.31E-01        2.41E-01        FM211187:252213-252312;FM211187.832;;FM211187.834
   TTTTTTTATAGATTTCAGGATCAGCCAAATAGTAATCCG 8.42E-01        1.03E-36        2.99E-10        -4.38E-01       6.83E-02        2.53E-01        FM211187:723388-723417;FM211187.2367;;FM211187.2371
   TTTTTTTATAGATTTCAGGATCAGCCAAATAGTAATCCGCCAGCTGGCGTT     8.39E-01        3.38E-35        4.04E-09        -3.95E-01       6.62E-02        2.37E-01        FM211187:1614084-1614122;penA;penA;penA

The output format is ``contig:position;upstream;in;downstream``.
The first line shows the k-mer was mapped to ``FM211187:252213-252312``, the
nearest gene downstream having ID ``FM211187.832`` and upstream having ID ``FM211187.834``.
The third line shows that k-mer overlaps *penA* -- note when a ``gene=`` field
is found this is used in preference to the ``ID=`` field.

Finally, we can summarise these annotations to create a plot of significant
genes. We will only use genes k-mers are actually in, but if we wanted to we
could also include up/downstream genes by using the ``--nearby`` option::

   python scripts/summarise_annotations.py annotated_kmers.txt > gene_hits.txt

We'll use ``ggplot2`` in ``R`` to plot these results::

   require(ggplot2)
   require(ggrepel)
   library(ggrepel)

   gene_hits = read.table("gene_hits.txt", stringsAsFactors=FALSE, header=TRUE)

   ggplot(gene_hits, aes(x=avg_beta, y=maxp, colour=avg_maf, size=hits, label=gene)) +
      geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
      geom_text_repel(aes(size=60), show.legend = FALSE, colour='black') +
      scale_size("Number of k-mers", range=c(1,10)) +
      scale_colour_gradient('Average MAF') +
      theme_bw(base_size=14) +
      ggtitle("Penicillin resistance") +
      xlab("Average effect size") +
      ylab("Maximum -log10(p-value)")

You can customise this however you wish (for example adding the customary italics on gene
names); these commands will produce a plot like this:

.. image:: pen_plot.png
   :alt: Summary of gene annotations
   :align: center

The main hits have high p-values and are common, and in this case are covered
by many k-mers. In this case *penA* (*pbp2b*) and *penX* (*pbp2x*) are the main
hits. Other top genes *recR* and *ddl* are adjacent to the *pbp* genes and `are
in LD with them <https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/16/12/1687/2925385>`_,
creating an artifical association.
The results with large effect sizes (recall that the odds-ratio is given by
:math:`e^{\beta}`) and relatively low p-values also have low MAF, and are
probably false positives. This can be seen better by changing the axes:
